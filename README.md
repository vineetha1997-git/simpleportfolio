### Portfolio Website Description

I created a portfolio website using HTML and CSS, consisting of two pages: a Home page and a Contact page. The site is designed to provide a clear and engaging introduction to my skills and projects in web development.

#### Key Features:

- **Home Page**: This page serves as an introduction to my work, featuring a brief overview of my skills, experience, and the technologies I specialize in. It showcases my passion for web development and includes visuals or links to some of my key projects, allowing visitors to quickly grasp my capabilities.

- **Contact Page**: The contact page provides an easy way for potential clients or collaborators to reach out. It includes a simple contact form where visitors can enter their name, email, and message. Additionally, I’ve included links to my social media profiles and professional networks for further engagement.

The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Through CSS, I’ve focused on creating a clean and modern aesthetic that reflects my personal style while maintaining professionalism.
